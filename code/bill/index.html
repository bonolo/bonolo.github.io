              <p>I needed placeholder text for a semantic HTML5 exercise and was tired of <span lang="la">Lorem ipsum</span>. I also wanted a finicky document structure. The original Bill of Rights was written in pen and ink, so its structure is quite unlike modern, type-set text. Thoughts&hellip;</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The phrase <cite>Bill of Rights</cite> appears nowhere in the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_zoom_1.html">original document</a>. To compromise, I put "Bill of Rights" in the &lt;title&gt; tag, but kept the text as-was.</li>
                <li>CSS has no :first-word psuedo-element yet, so I typed the preamble headings' first words in all caps, rather than adding HTML &lt;span&gt; tags for styling.</li>
                <li>The layout is awkward and unappealing, but I chose to approximate it as best I could with CSS. (Those first-line indents are crazy.)</li>
                <li>The document is designed <q>to prevent misconstruction or abuse of [government] powers</q> granted in the Constitution.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Honestly, the Bill of Rights has been my favorite thing about the United States since elementary school. Reading it today provides a telling lens through which to view our own times.</p>
